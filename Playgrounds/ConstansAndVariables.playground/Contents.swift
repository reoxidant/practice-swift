//u can't to change value of constant, if u try the code can't be a runner
let const = "any text"
//const = "i wanna have another text" //get a error of compilation

//print variable or string into console
print("console log")

//or variable

print(myName, terminator:"")

//interpolation var or let type in a string value
print("The name of create is \(myName)")
